"As a result, ""The warmest  year on US record is now 1934."	This decade is on track to become the warmest since records began in 1850, and 2009 could rank among the top-five warmest years, the U.N. weather agency reported Tuesday on the second day of a pivotal 192-nation climate conference.

The world has entered a 'cold mode' which is likely to bring a global dip in temperatures which will last for 20 to 30 years, they say.	One of the targets that has been suggested is to limit the future increase in global mean temperature (global warming) to below 2 °C, relative to the pre-industrial level.	NOT_ENOUGH_INFO	327
Tony Abbott the Opposition must respect the Government's mandate to overturn the carbon tax.	Following the first Gillard Government budget in May 2011, Abbott used his budget-reply speech to reiterate his critiques of government policy and call for an early election over the issue of a carbon tax.

'The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change misled the press and public into believing that thousands of scientists backed its claims on manmade global warming, according to Mike Hulme, a prominent climate scientist and IPCC insider.	The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science.	REFUTES	218
Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors of climate change, but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one.	According to the United States National Research Council, [T]here is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities.

"...there is the contention by Wolfgang Knorr of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in England that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are about where they were 160 years ago."" (as quoted by Ken Ward Jr.)"	The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods.

During the period 1940 to 1976 there was a cooling of the climate despite increasing CO2 levels.	Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.

Venus doesn't have a runaway greenhouse effect	The planet Venus experienced runaway greenhouse effect, resulting in an atmosphere which is 96% carbon dioxide, with surface atmospheric pressure roughly the same as found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth.	REFUTES	231
In fact, the authors go on to estimate climate sensitivity from their findings, calculate a value between 2.3 to 4.1°C.	The IPCC literature assessment estimates that TCR likely lies between 1 °C and 2.5 °C.	REFUTES	264
Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.	It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents.	REFUTES	441
President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions, but China and India will still be allowed to increase their emissions.	The country submitted a proposed protocol which would have imposed deeper, legally binding emissions cuts, including on developing nations.	REFUTES	268
The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time.	Hurricane wind speeds, rainfall intensity, and storm surge levels are likely to increase.	REFUTES	282
CO2 increase is natural, not human-caused.	While CO 2 absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO 2 levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human (anthropogenic) activity.	REFUTES	360
Venus is not hot because of a runaway greenhouse.	He also perceived global warming as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect.	REFUTES	212
It “certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica’s ice is just going up and up,” Meier said.	"Study concludes Antarctica is gaining ice, rather than losing it""."	REFUTES	236
This argument originates from Angstrom's work in 1901.	Anders Jonas Ångström (Swedish: [ˈânːdɛʂ ˈjûːnas ˈɔ̂ŋːstrœm]; 13 August 1814 – 21 June 1874) was a Swedish physicist and one of the founders of the science of spectroscopy.	REFUTES	209

Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change.”	Climate change, through rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and changing sea levels, will affect the nature of hydrometeorological disasters, such as droughts, floods, and cyclones.

There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S.	Widespread heavy rainfall contributed to significant inland flooding from Louisiana into Arkansas.	REFUTES	354
there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, while deaths attributed to such natural disasters have never been fewer	So [the] frequency, [the] ferocity of untimely rains increases, [along with] erratic monsoons, droughts and floods; all these are caused [by climate change].

In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet.	Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.	REFUTES	255
There's no empirical evidence for climate change.	Climate change has proven to affect biodiversity and evidence supporting the altering effects is widespread.	REFUTES	432
