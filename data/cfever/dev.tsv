429	There is a link between climate change and the NSW bushfires.	On 21 October, Christiana Figueres, a UN official on climate change, told CNN: The World Meteorological Organization has not established a direct link between this wildfire and climate change – yet.	REFUTES
430	Global warming' and 'climate change' mean different things and have both been used for decades.	Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably.	REFUTES
431	Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark the next ice age.	"A 40-y record reveals gradual Antarctic sea ice increases followed by decreases at rates far exceeding the rates seen in the Arctic""."	REFUTES
432	There's no empirical evidence for climate change.	Climate change has proven to affect biodiversity and evidence supporting the altering effects is widespread.	REFUTES
433	“Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity.	"(2009) found that the evidence showed that connections between solar variation and climate were more likely to be mediated by direct variation of insolation rather than cosmic rays, and concluded: ""Hence within our assumptions, the effect of varying solar activity, either by direct solar irradiance or by varying cosmic ray rates, must be less than 0.07 °C since 1956, i.e."	REFUTES
434	Climate change need not endanger anyone”	The species said to be most at risk for endangerment or extinction are populations that are not of conservation concern.	REFUTES
435	Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past.	Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium.	REFUTES
436	"Disasters Cost More Than Ever — But Not Because of Climate Change"" (Roger Pielke Jr.)"	By addressing climate change, we can avoid the costs associated with the effects of climate change.	REFUTES
437	"Thus rather than a ""doomsday"" cycle of runaway warming, Mother Earth appears surprisingly tolerant of carbon, decreasing atmospheric levels of water vapor -- a more effective greenhouse gas -- to compensate."	"Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this results in further warming and so is a ""positive feedback"" that amplifies the original warming."	REFUTES
438	“It’s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic, and now the Antarctic, is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice.	"A 40-y record reveals gradual Antarctic sea ice increases followed by decreases at rates far exceeding the rates seen in the Arctic""."	REFUTES
439	A windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.	The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months.	REFUTES
440	"Scientists are ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. "	In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.

441	Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.	It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents.	REFUTES
442	Global warming data apparently cooked by U.S. government-funded body  shows astounding temperature fraud with increases averaging 10 to 15  degrees Fahrenheit.	A projected increase of 4.05 degrees Fahrenheit in average temperature is expected by 2065, and a projected increase of 9.37 degrees Fahrenheit in average temperature can be expected by the turn of the century if nothing is done to curb emissions.

443	Heat waves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally.	The famous heat wave events of Chicago in 1995 and the European heat wave of 2003 regions will experience longer, more frequent and more intense heat waves in the latter 21st century.	REFUTES
444	Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees.	"As estimated by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), ""there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely less than 1°C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely between 1.5°C and 4.5°C and very unlikely greater than 6°C""."

445	The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”	The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million.

446	Together, these two unaltered [sea level] datasets indicate that global mean sea level trend has remained stable over the entire period 1992-2007, altogether eliminating the apparent 3.2 mm/year rate of sea-level rise arising from the “adjusted” data.	Measurements by Jason-1 indicate that mean sea level has been rising at an average rate of 2.28 millimeters (.09 inches) per year since 2001.	REFUTES
